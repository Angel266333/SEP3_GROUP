The kstore.jks file is supposed to be placed in the current user folder (home folder).

To get this folder path, run the GETMYHOMEFOLDER.bat file.

Place the kstore.jks file in this folder.

Run the data layer first, followed by the business layer and finally, the application layer.

The first time you run the business layer, type 'token generate' (no quotes).
